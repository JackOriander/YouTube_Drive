# Hello (´･ω･`)
This is a **<sub>personal</sub> *<sup>fun</sup>* <sub>project</sub>** , so feel free to contribute **(＾◇＾)**

# What is This Repository?
There are many projects out there in or out of Git that does the same thing as me more *efficiently*, but I quite didn't liked those programs.

**So, <sub>I</sub> <sup>made</sup> <sub>my</sub> OWN. (Ｔ▽Ｔ)**

What this program really does is just take any file and convert it into a video file and upload it to YouTube. Although this project is still in the development phase, i hope i can finish this in time. **(`･ω･´)**

# Completion?
**No**, this project isn't completed yet.
I'm gonna add a lot of things in future so feel free to tag along or support me by giving it a **Star**.

# Last Words
